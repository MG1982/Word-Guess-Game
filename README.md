- If the word is madonna, display it like this when the game starts: \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_.
- As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: m a d o \_ \_ a.
- Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).
- Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like L Z Y H).
